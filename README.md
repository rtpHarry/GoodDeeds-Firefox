Good-Deeds v1.1
=====================

About Good-Deeds
----------------

Good-Deeds is a simple extension for the Firefox web browser that helps you do a little bit of good each day. Once a day it will pop up a tab with The Rainforest Site contained in it. Every time you click on the big button you are helping preserve endagered land in the rainforest!

This wont cost you a penny because the money that is donated is provided by other like-minded green/eco-friendly companies that agree to pay a small fee for the chance to advertise their products on the page you click through to.

Peace of Mind
-------------

The Rainforest Site network sites does not install any software, force you to sign up for anything, ask you for money, or hassle you in any way. The only time you will every hear from The Rainforest Site is if you visit them.

What is The Rainforest Site?
----------------------------

In their own words:

The Rainforest Site is dedicated to the preservation of rainforests around the world. Your daily click funds the purchase of rainforest land by The Nature Conservancy, The Rainforest Conservation Fund, The World Parks Endowment, and The Friends of Calakmul. These organizations work to preserve rainforest land in Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay and other locations worldwide.

On average, over 35,500 individuals from around the world visit the site each day to click the green "Preserve Endangered Land" button. To date, more than 150 million visitors have preserved more than 40,500 acres of land.

They also run the following sites (which are supported by this extension): Hungers Site, Breast Cancer Site, Literacy Site, Animal Rescue Site.

If you still have questions then why not visit one of their sites and see for yourself how simple it is.

Download
--------

You can get this extension directly from this site. Because Firefox is a secure browser and worries about what you're installing it will question whether you really want to do this. Just allow the site when the yellow bar appears along the top of this window, and then click install when the timer runs down.

If you are not an experienced Firefox user then you might feel better getting this file directly from the official Firefox addons site (TODO: Sorry, this plugin hasn't been approved yet, the link will be added soon!).

Compatibility
-------------

This extension is compatible with Mozilla Firefox v1.5 to v22.0.
