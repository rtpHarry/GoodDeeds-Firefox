Good-Deeds v1.1
=====================

About Good-Deeds
----------------

Good-Deeds is a simple extension for the Firefox web browser that helps you do a little bit of good each day. Once a day it will pop up a tab with The Rainforest Site contained in it. Every time you click on the big button you are helping preserve endagered land in the rainforest!

This wont cost you a penny because the money that is donated is provided by other like-minded green/eco-friendly companies that agree to pay a small fee for the chance to advertise their products on the page you click through to.

What is The Rainforest Site?
----------------------------

In their own words:

> The Rainforest Site is dedicated to the preservation of rainforests around the world. Your daily click funds the purchase of rainforest land by The Nature Conservancy, The Rainforest Conservation Fund, The World Parks Endowment, and The Friends of Calakmul. These organizations work to preserve rainforest land in Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay and other locations worldwide.

> On average, over 60,000 individuals from around the world visit the site each day to click the green "Preserve Endangered Land" button. To date, more than 150 million visitors have preserved more than 40,500 acres of land.

They also run the following sites (which are supported by this extension): The Hunger Site, The Breast Cancer Site, The Literacy Site, The Animal Rescue Site, The Veterans Site, The Autism Site and The Diabetes Site
